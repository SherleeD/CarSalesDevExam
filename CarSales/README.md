# Carsales Dev Exam

I used the following:
 - Visual Studio 2019 Community Edition
 - .Net Core 3.1 framework
 - Data persisted using MS SQL Server 2019
 - Implemented Clean Architecture using MediatR and CQRS design pattern.
 - For unit testing XUnit and Moq
 - For the frontend I use ASP.NET Core Web Application MVC

 The web api has the following endpints:
  - endpoint for listing the vehicle type properties
  - endpoint for saving the created vehicle

  For the test data I created a script(InsertTestDataScript.sql) to insert prerequisite data for the following:
  - vehicle properties
  - vehicle type properties
